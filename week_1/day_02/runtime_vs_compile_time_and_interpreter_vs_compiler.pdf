Runtime vs compile time

Runtime(execuation time) --> Runtime is when your code is executed.
                              Runtime (or execution time) occurs when your compiled program is actually executed by the computer.
                              
                              Runtime errors can be:
                                    ○ Division by zero
                                    ○ Square root of negative numbers,
                                    etc

            
            
            
Compile Time --> Compile time When you build your code. It refers to the phase when your program is transformed into machine readable 
                    code(0, 1).
                    
                Compile time errors can be:
                    ○ Syntax errors
                    ○ Semantic errors
                    
                    
Interpreter Vs Compiler

Interpreter --> Interpreter is a program that converts source code to machine code line by line when program is executed.
                Example: Python, Ruby, etc
                
                
Compiler -->  Compiler is a program that converts source code to machine code in one go and generate executable file that can be run directly               by the computer 

              Example: C, C++, Java etc
