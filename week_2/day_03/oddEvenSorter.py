# # Task 02: List Manipulation - Odd-Even Sorter

# ## Objective

# Create a program that takes a list of numbers from the user, sorts them into two separate lists (one for odd numbers and one for even numbers), and displays the sorted lists.

# ## Requirements

# 1. Ask the user to input a list of numbers (comma-separated).
# 2. Sort the numbers into two lists: one for odd numbers and one for even numbers.
# 3. Display both lists.

# ## Additional Challenges

# 1. Allow the user to input any type of values (not just numbers) and handle different data types.
# 2. Enhance the program to display the sorted lists in ascending or descending order.
